# API_Interaction---Football-data.org
A project developed for my masters, where we connected to an API via python and were able to access daily updated data from all the top european leagues and competitions.

The challenge that was proposed here was to connect to the API from the https://www.football-data.org/ website (Sign up to get a free trial and your own login and entry token) and try to obtain 2 random statistics of series of events at our choosing. Because of Bayer Leversuken's phenomenal season, I was drawn to the German League (Bundesliga), so commited myself for that league and to find out two events:

  1. Which are the best teams to hold an advantage at half time and win (at their home side).
    
  2. Which teams are the best at turning the score after losing at half-time (any side, home or away).
